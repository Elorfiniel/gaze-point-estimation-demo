# PoG Estimation Models

Please download into this folder the PoG estimation models listed below. Rename the model to `model.onnx`, or change the model filename in `estimator/estimator.toml` to the desired one. If you are using the bundled application, modifying `config.toml` will also work.

### Preview Model (Coming Soon)

This model, trained on self-collected PoG data, is provided **for public preview only**, and is not intended for production use. The model may not be as accurate or reliable as the production release, and its performance should be carefully evaluated before any real-world deployment. Use at your own risk.

### Production Model

This model is trained on proprietary data provided by partner companies, thus not publicly distributable due to contractual agreements.
